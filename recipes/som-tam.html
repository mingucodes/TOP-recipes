  <h3>description</h3>

  <p>Som Tam Thai is the salad eaten by every Thai. Fresh, healthy and as spicy as you want, it's a great change. You can make it at home quickly and easily for a real change to your regular salads.</p>

  <p>The importance of Som Tam reaches almost epic importance in the essence of life for quite a lot of Thais, with us becoming moody and feeling like part of our life is missing if we cannot eat it for any significant period of time - meaning a few days. I don't want you to feel like that so let's go make it - ha ha!</p>

  <h3>ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>shredded papaya</li>
    <li>shredded carrot</li>
    <li>cloves of thai garlic</li>
    <li>small tomata</li>
    <li>dried shrimp</li>
    <li>palm sugar</li>
    <li>fish sauce</li>
    <li>vegan fish sauce</li>
    <li>tamarind paste</li>
    <li>lime juice</li>
    <li>roasted peanuts</li>
    <li>long green beans</li>
    <li>fresh vegetables</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Using a shredding tool, shred the papaya into small strips.</li>
    <li>Shred the carrot in a similar fashion.</li>
    <li>Take the tops off the chili and the outer skin off the garlic. Place them in the Mortar and crush together with the pestle.</li>
    <li>Add in the sugar, fish or soy sauce, tamarind juice, and lime juice and gently massage the juices into the chili and garlic combination.</li>
    <li>Our tomatoes are sliced or quartered, added, and given a quick bop with the pestle to release the juices and bruise them up without mangling the sections. </li>
    <li>Then add the shredded papaya and onions, using the pestle to mix together all the ingredients gently to coat with the sauce.</li>
    <li>Gently spoon out your lovingly nurtured Som Tam Thai onto a plate trying not to let the juice splash all over the place. </li>
  </ol>
